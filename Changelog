1.5.0
Updated the fetching code and parser to use the new service URL and JSON format.
Changed the widgets to show the wind speed, removing the description since none
is supplied in the JSON forecast.
Included latitude, longitude and altitude information with the place data as
these replace place specifiers as part of requests. As a result, custom place
names can no longer be used to obtain forecasts.

1.4.2
Updated dependency information to fix an API mismatch that caused a crash at
start-up.

1.4.1
Updated dependency information to fix F-Droid builds.

1.4.0
Added a screen to allow sizes of symbols and labels to be configured.

1.3.0
Removed daytime handling code, using the "var" attribute of "symbol"
elements to determine the correct symbol to use.

1.2.1
Added build dependency metadata to help with F-Droid builds.

1.2.0
Added code to work around HTTPS issues related to the lack of support for
SSLv3 and TLSv1.0,1.1 on the yr.no server, coupled with a bug that causes
protocol negotiation to fall back to SSLv3, plus lack of support for TLSv1.2
on older Android devices.

What should happen is this:

 * If we can't use secure communications then we fall back to HTTP and warn the
   user before any communications are performed.
 * On Android version >= 5 and later, things should just work.
 * On Android 4.1 <= version < 5 we try to use a custom socket factory that
   creates sockets using the TLSv1.2 protocol.
 * On Android version <= 4.0 we just fall back to HTTP and warn the user.

1.1.0
Reverted the change to the method which determines whether a forecast time is
between sunrise and sunset. This ignores the date, and only compares the time
again.

1.0.9
Fixed the forecast parser to treat times as local times instead of UTC times.

1.0.8
Updated the time for cached forecasts to 60 minutes to comply with the terms
of service:

1.0.7
Changed the activity and background task to perform forecast parsing in the
background. This tries to avoid potential problems if a network failure occurs
after a connection is made but before the data is fetched and parsed.

1.0.6
Ensured that place names are correctly decoded from the values stored in the
locations.txt file. Ideally, we would store the names along with these values.

1.0.5
Added a special check to allow unrecognised names to be interpreted as place specifiers.

Added instructions for adding custom locations directly to the locations.txt file.

1.0.4
Created a simplified version of the icon used as the launcher icon so that
tools used to create PNG images can more accurately represent the original
image.

Refactored the network code to run in a separate thread in order to make the
application behave properly when built for newer SDK versions.

1.0.2
[Build] Disabled the use of the icon cache.

1.0.1
[Build] Added a version number for inclusion in the package manifest.

1.0.0
Added information about building the application without signing.
Added information about the application version and the version of the
toolchain used to build it.
